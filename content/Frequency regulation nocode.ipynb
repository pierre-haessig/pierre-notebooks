    "### 1) Without frequency regulation\n",

    "You can explore the effect on the frequency of:\n",

    "And *without* frequency regulation, except if the power mismatch is strictly 0, it's only a matter of time before crashing the grid (with blackout or over-frequency).\n",
    "\n",
    "Optionally, you can make the power mismatch become zero after a few seconds (`T_ŒîP` ‚Üí 4s). This stops the frequency change, but doesn‚Äôt make it come back to its nominal value. Make sure, however, to reset to a permanent mismatch (`T_ŒîP` ‚Üí permanent) before going on to the next section.\n",

    "### 2) With frequency regulation\n",

    "You can explore the effect of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- regulation inverse gain `s` (smaller means stronger regulation): affects the final frequency value, but not the initial rate of change (RoCoF)\n",
    "- grid inertia (`H` is seconds): affects the initial rate of change (RoCoF) as without FCR, but no effect of the final value\n",
    "- intensity of power mismatch (excess of consumption `ŒîP_load`): affects both the final frequency value, and the initial RoCoF\n",

    "### 3) With imperfect frequency regulation (lag)\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, to get a realistic frequency trajectory, we should account of the slowness of the devices (often: steam or gas turbines) which contribute to the frequency regulation. **Activate the regulation lag** (`fcr_lag` ‚Üí on). Witness the **frequency oscillations** before stabilization. An important value to monitor is the frequency nadir, that is the smallest transient value. It should be kept above the threshold of the automatic devices which disconnect consumers in case of low frequency (see (*) below). You can explore the *opposing* effects of:\n",
